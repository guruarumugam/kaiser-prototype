# Kaiser Prototype

**Kaiser is in the early stages of development**

Kaiser is Trello designed for developers.  It's a take on the kanban approach
popularized by apps like Trello, modified to work for developers.

Specifically Kaiser differents from Trello (and other kanban apps) in the following ways:

 - A board isn't limited to one set of columns.  In Kaiser there are multiple
   rows or ('lines' as they are called in Kaiser lingo).
 - TODO - finish this list

Ultimately Kaiser is about showing you the status of your project at a glance.
By simply looking at the board you can find all the answers you need as a
developer, tester or scrum master/project manager/product owner (or whatever
your methodology calls them):

 - How many tasks are blocked and what are they?
 - How many tasks are ready for testing?
 - Whether a particular task is in development (and the number of todos remaining to complete development)
 - Whether a particular task is development complete, but has bugs that have come out of testing.
 - TODO - finish this list
